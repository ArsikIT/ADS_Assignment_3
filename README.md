MyHashTable and Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation in Java
This project contains two fundamental data structure implementations:

MyHashTable: A custom hash table implementation using separate chaining (linked lists).

Binary Search Tree (BST): A simple implementation of a binary search tree with standard operations.

Both data structures are implemented in Java and provide basic functionalities like insertion, deletion, and search.


MyHashTable
Features:
Insert (put): Adds a key-value pair to the hash table.

Get (get): Retrieves the value associated with a key.

Delete (remove): Removes a key-value pair from the hash table.

Contains: Checks if a key exists in the hash table.

Size: Returns the number of elements in the hash table.

Print Buckets: Prints the number of elements in each bucket (linked list).


Binary Search Tree (BST)
Features:
Insert (put): Adds a key-value pair into the binary search tree.

Get (get): Retrieves the value associated with a key.

Delete (delete): Removes a key-value pair from the tree.

In-order: Iterates through the tree in ascending order of keys.

Size: Returns the number of elements in the tree.

Iterator: Iterates over the tree's key-value pairs in order.
